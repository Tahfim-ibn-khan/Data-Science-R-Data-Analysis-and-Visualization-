Data Cleaning and Preparation</h3> <ul> <li>Handled missing values by replacing them with median values.</li> <li>Formatted categorical and numeric variables as needed for analysis.</li> </ul> <h3>2. Statistical Analysis</h3> <ul> <li>Performed chi-squared tests to evaluate relationships between categorical variables and target variables.</li> <li>Conducted Kendall's correlation to assess relationships between numeric variables and target variables.</li> </ul> <h3>3. Data Visualization</h3> <ul> <li>Created scatter plots, bar plots, and scatterplot matrices for mental health analysis.</li> <li>Visualized distributions with histograms, box plots, and violin plots for bike selling price data.</li> <li>Developed line plots to track trends over time and kilometers driven.</li> <li>Examined relationships between variables using scatter plots (e.g., selling price vs. ex-showroom price).</li> </ul> <h3>4. Insights and Trends</h3> <ul> <li>Identified key statistical relationships and visualized trends between variables.</li> <li>Provided actionable insights based on correlations and patterns in the datasets.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The projects successfully applied data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover valuable insights. These processes are crucial for understanding complex datasets and preparing them for predictive modeling and decision-making.</p> </body> </html>
